# WELCOME
Hi! Welcome to my react website project.

This project applies the knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript alongside the 
React.js framework.

This project places heavy emphasis on responsive design and should be fit for a wide range of devices from mobile phones to 4k monitors.

Please ensure you have the standard range of node_modules installed in your directory.

If there is an error with the node_modules folder where there are missing imports,run the following commands to import the icons used in this project:

### `npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core`
### `npm install --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`
### `npm install --save @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons`
### `npm install --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome`

There might be more code comments than a usual project will contain and is purely used to help me learn better.

### Below is autogenerated by the React template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
